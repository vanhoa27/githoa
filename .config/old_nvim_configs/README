Dear reader,

Sadly Vimscript is and outdated way to setup your Vim especially Neovim.
If you read this you should make the switch to Lua an actual programming language!

To get started search for: -- VIMRC 2022 ThePrimeagean Youtube
                           -- NVIM from Scratch Youtube Series

That should be it for the beginning.
See you in a bit!
