If I new about all of this before I wouldn't have had to tinker so
much with Obsidian or all of this Stuff concerning writing Notes
int pure Latex. I could've focused my efforts on something different.
In the first place. I do use Neovim and prefer it over vanilla **Vim**.
So why did I decide to set up all of this stuff in Vim. Like lmao 
this is so random. But Now that I know all of this. I can take notes
in Emacs, Obsidian and Neovim. And if you count notetaking in pure 
Latex, then perhaps you can say that I can also use Vim for taking
notes
